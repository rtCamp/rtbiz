<h4>üîê Privacy</h4>
Redux does not interact with end users on your website. Our templates will continue to work even if Redux is uninstalled. If a product is using Redux the option panel will cease to function without Redux.

Redux utilizes [AppSero](https://appsero.com/) for account management as well as to enable our premium offerings. You can find their privacy policy here: [https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/](https://appsero.com/privacy-policy/). Activation of Redux is not necessary, but additional features such as Google Font Updates and increased access to the template library will be limited.

The Redux plugin uses a custom API to fetch our content library and our Gutenberg templates. To improve the service and stability we store logs which may or may not contain the following:
<ul>
<li>browser type</li>
<li>referring site</li>
<li>date and time of request</li>
<li>category selection or search term</li>
<li>anonymized IP address</li>
</ul>

API requests are only made when a user clicks on the Library button, launches the Redux Challenge, or opts into Google Font updates.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Once Installed and Activated you will be invited to Activate your Redux account. This is entirely voluntary and easily dismissed.

If you want, you can use the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) plugin to get bleeding-edge experiments by the Gutenberg team.
